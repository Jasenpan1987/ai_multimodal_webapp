Each deployment can be backed by native data using `client.beta.vector_stores.create` API by OpenAI. 

This project aims to serve as a template for you to work on building/connecting a model, fine-tuning or enabling RAG by simply uploading files in OpenAI assistant playground and serving your AI solution to the world in minutes. 

Follow the instructions and you should have the project live responding to your use case in no time. Yes familiarity quotient with nextjs, vercel, clerk and openai can make it relatively faster or slower to deploy. But the process overall aims to remain a breeze. Write in if you're stuck somewhere.
